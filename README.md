# MyCustomDalamudPluginRepoCollection
A collection of multiple dalamud repos, merged into a single file for easier distribution to friends.
The list will check every 30 min for updates (and pushes automaticly to github if any important update is found).

If you know of a repo that is missing in my list, feel free to create a PR/issue so i can add it to the list.

Checkout [repo_urls.json](https://github.com/Akurosia/MyCustomDalamudPluginRepoCollection/blob/main/repo_urls.json) for a list of repos.
